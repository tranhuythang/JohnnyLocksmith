## Website for a Locksmith Shop## 

This is a website for a real locksmith shop in Phoenix. I will make this as my Perscholas capstone project. Obviously, it's in the very early stage of development.

Supposed Functions of the website: 

- log in/out; 
- check if the shop can clone the key of a specific car, e.g. Honda Pilot 2007.
- place an order of cloning car/door keys or emergent unlock for car/door
- read and write feedback/review

Current Tech used in this website:
- Javascript: cookies for log in/out; DOM manipulation
- CSS: flex box
